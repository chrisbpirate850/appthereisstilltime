            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              I'm Christopher J. Bradley. At 19, I drove a tank in the Gulf War. I saw things no 19-year-old should see.
              I came home with invisible wounds that would take 24 years to properly diagnose. PTSD doesn't ask permission
              to destroy your life‚Äîit just does.
            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed">
              When I came home, I promised myself I would overachieve out of gratitude for being alive. I graduated from Penn State. I married my college sweetheart. I graduated from law school. We had a daughter‚Äîour greatest achievement, my reason for
              everything. My wife graduated from medical school 8 years later.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Loss</h2>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A year later, divorce. I was shocked. I tried to rebuild. Four years later, a second divorce. Homelessness in New York City. Rock bottom isn't a place you visit‚Äîit's where you learn
              who you really are. Then slowly the family courts' ignorance of‚Äîor ignoring of‚Äîthe U.S. Constitution destroyed my relationship with my daughter. Not because I was unfit‚Äîbecause the system is broken.
              I fought. I did everything right. It didn't matter.
            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Parental alienation is real. One day you're a father. The next, you're erased. I haven't seen my daughter
              in 6 years. She doesn't know that I think about her every single day. She doesn't know that everything I'm
              building is for her.

            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For most of the last decade, I lived alone on a sailboat on the northwest coast of Florida. Boggy Bayou became
              my monastery. I photographed over 2,000 sunsets from the same sacred space.
            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In that stillness, I learned through living the greatest lesson: <strong className="text-white">Life is simple. Love everyone,
              and start with yourself.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed">
              I came to understand three fundamental truths that changed everything:

              I couldn't save my family. But I could build tools to help others save theirs. I could channel my pain

            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              I know what focus under pressure means. I drove a tank in combat at 19. I took the SAT and LSAT. I studied for the bar exam. I was present for my ex-wife through a post-baccalaureate program, the MCAT, and four years of medical school. I fought in courtrooms for
              the fundamental right to parent my daughter.
            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This timer is built for students preparing for high-stakes exams‚ÄîMCAT, LSAT, Bar Exam, USMLE. Because
              I understand what it means to study when everything is on the line. I understand what it means to need
              every minute to count.
            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              But it's also built for anyone who needs a reminder: <strong className="text-white">time is passing, and
              how you use it matters.</strong>

              Every project I build, every word I write, every sunset I photograph‚Äîit's all been my way of staying

              Focus isn't just about passing exams. It's about presence. It's about consciousness. It's about choosing

            </p>
            <p className="text-twilight-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Every session you complete is practice for life. Every moment you choose focus over distraction is practice
              for love. Every time you show up is proof that there is still time to become who you're meant to be.
